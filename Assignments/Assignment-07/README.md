<h1>High Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
<h2>Purpose & Process</h2>
The purpose of this project is to create a high fidelity prototype for a family connection app that contains three main features being a shared calendar, shared lists,
and daily wellness tasks. The app aims to encourage family connection through organizational features, but aims to broaden the user's experience by promoting communication to user families.

<h2>Supported Tasks</h2>
The prototype can support these current user tasks:
* Answering a daily question and setting daily status from the home screen. (Flow 1)
* Checking overview of family members. (Flow 1)
* Checking family member daily answer and status. (Flow 1)
* Checking a shared calendar. (Flow 2)
* Checking a shared list and removing an item. (Flow 2)
* Display a link to invite other users. (Flow 3)
* Displaying Sidebar Tabs and using navigating Home. (Flow 1)

<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
My roommates Matthew and Ethan assisted in partaking in a cognitive walkthrough for this project. The walkthrough consisted of giving initial impressions and performing all tasks represented in the three flows in the prototype. During initial impressions, a participant was asked to use the prototype freely for 1 minute. Afterwards, the participants were asked to perform; explore the family feature in the app, explore the events feature in the app, find an invite link to share to other users.

<h3>Findings Summary</h3>
The two cognitive walkthroughs gave a few key insights on the app's design.
1. The requested tasks were relatively easy to perform and required no major assistance. 
2. Ethan complimented the aesthetic of the app, particularly the color scheme being used.
3. Both participants had agreed that text could be made smaller in certain pages in order to show more content.

Based on the given feedback, I would agree that the text in certain pages could be made smaller in order to the reduce the amount of excess blank space. I would also slightly change some of the font coloring in the app in an attempt to make the text appear less abrasive when compared to the softer colored background. Throughout the creation of the prototype I found myself revising screens and overall layout as time went on. As more frames were created to support user tasks, I found that the vision and overall style of the app became clearer throughout the process. Usability testing in the coming weeks will help clarify last minute design choices as well as entirely improve the user flow and experience.
