# Motivating and Encouraging Family Connection

# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Alonzo Murrieta, DH110, Spring 2023

The discussion of mental health widely varies across cultures and families.
It often occurs where children of traditional families are shunned for speaking on topics such
as anxiety, depression, or other mental issues, and it is often the case where older figures in traditional families
were not properly taught what these topics may mean and their severity. This goes to say that the amount
at which families are comfortable in communicating their own thoughts and emotions to eachother is different to each family.
This disucssion motivated me to explore the design of current family connection apps and attempt to approve
the UX design by implementing features that encourages families to connect with eachother on a deeper emotional level.
