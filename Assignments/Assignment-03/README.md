# Assignment 3: User Research

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Research Goal & Requirements</h3>

What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
  * This project will support users who are looking for ways to create a deeper sense of connection within their family.
  The main goal is to relieve families of the initial barriers that prevent deeper levels of connection within the family. 
  It is often the case in traditional families where discussions of topics such as mental health are closed and hard to start.
  Whatever the reason for this may be, it may prove useful to offer digitized methods for families to begin communication on deeper levels.

What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
  * This activity fulfills the user's basic need for connection because it ultimately allows families members to open conversations on heavy topics that otherwise may be difficult to do alone or in person. 
  To create more family connection is to cultivate a sense of safety regarding difficult topics and allowing family members to speak comfortably with eachother. 

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
  * Current solutions to satisfy the need of more family connection typically involve spending time with family members in any form. 
  Common activities like going to dinner or taking a walk give time for family members to communicate with eachother in a natural way.
  In more extreme cases, families looking for a deeper sense of connection may take part in services such as family counseling or therapy.

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
  * The limitations to common ways of spending time with family members is that deeper connections and the discussion of more personal matters with family may be hard to bring up. 
  Children of traditional families may feel as if such discussion is not possible, and any family members looking for connection may simply feel too embarassed or unwanted to ask. 
  While the current solutions offer a time and space for deeper connection, it is the state of how the family communicates that determines whether these solutions may work. 
  While services such as counseling or therapy may open a deeper conversation, these services are limited in their formalities and infrequency.

<h3>Target Users</h3>

What are the characteristics of users?
  * The characteristics of users are typically teenagers or young adults who have access to the internet, and are looking for methods to create a deeper sense of connection with their family. 
  Still, the need for deeper family connection can be felt by any family member.

In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
  * Users would perform the activity of creating deeper family connection when they feel that there is a disconnect in the family, or feel as if the family is not communicating enough.
  Users may feel as if they cannot continue to act normally in the family because there is communicational block on a specific matter. 

What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
  * In order to create a greater sense of connection within the family, a family member that feels the need for more connection will typically organize an event or timeframe for family members to interact with eachother.
  In other cases, a family member may start a discussion on a topic like mental health or coordinate for a service like family counseling.
