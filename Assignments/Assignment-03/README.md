# Assignment 3: User Research

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Research Goal & Requirements</h3>

What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
  * This project will support users who are looking for ways to create a deeper sense of connection within their family.
  The main goal is to relieve families of the initial barriers that prevent deeper levels of connection within the family. 
  It is often the case in traditional families where discussions of topics such as mental health are closed and hard to start.
  Whatever the reason for this may be, it may prove useful to offer digitized methods for families to begin communication on deeper levels.

What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
  * This activity fulfills the user's basic need for connection because it ultimately allows families members to open conversations on heavy topics that otherwise may be difficult to do alone or in person. 
  To create more family connection is to cultivate a sense of safety regarding difficult topics and allowing family members to speak comfortably with eachother. 

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
  * Current solutions to satisfy the need of more family connection typically involve spending time with family members in any form. 
  Common activities like going to dinner or taking a walk give time for family members to communicate with eachother in a natural way.
  In more extreme cases, families looking for a deeper sense of connection may take part in services such as family counseling or therapy.

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
  * The limitations to common ways of spending time with family members is that deeper connections and the discussion of more personal matters with family may be hard to bring up. 
  Children of traditional families may feel as if such discussion is not possible, and any family members looking for connection may simply feel too embarassed or unwanted to ask. 
  While the current solutions offer a time and space for deeper connection, it is the state of how the family communicates that determines whether these solutions may work. 
  While services such as counseling or therapy may open a deeper conversation, these services are limited in their formalities and infrequency.

<h3>Target Users</h3>

What are the characteristics of users?
  * The characteristics of users are typically teenagers or young adults who have access to the internet, and are looking for methods to create a deeper sense of connection with their family. 
  Still, the need for deeper family connection can be felt by any family member.

In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
  * Users would perform the activity of creating deeper family connection when they feel that there is a disconnect in the family, or feel as if the family is not communicating enough.
  Users may feel as if they cannot continue to act normally in the family because there is communicational block on a specific matter. 

What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
  * In order to create a greater sense of connection within the family, a family member that feels the need for more connection will typically organize an event or timeframe for family members to interact with eachother.
  In other cases, a family member may start a discussion on a topic like mental health or coordinate for a service like family counseling.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<h4>Key Insights</h4>

What is the method?
 * Chang 9:20: This method is typing in tips and a topic and putting reddit after it so you can read other people’s anecdotes and personal accounts. It’s anonymous and feels more personal sometimes.

Is this something [family counseling] your family would try? Would they consider it?
 * Chang 16:30: No, no. I think their attitude towards it would be “we can just have conversations ourselves”. I feel like they (my outer family) don't like bringing outer people into the family business. There’s also the idea of shame and opening up to someone else.

Are there ways in which you think this method [family counseling] hinders family connection?
 * Chang 17:28: Yeah, I think that if it goes badly it could make things worse after. If the conversations that were had went bad and didn’t have a conclusion and it left people to go out on their own it could harm things in the future. If people are too honest it could offend people.


Are there any methods to connect with family that you are aware of and avoid? 
 * Chang 22:15: I feel like sometimes families are really rude to each other, in a way for them to show how open with each other they are. Methods that involve blurring the line between respect and connection are ones I avoid.


If you could create an app that put you in a group with your family, what features would you like in it?
 * Chang 23:18: I would imagine it lets us message and call and send pictures, and maybe how slack lets you make your own emojis. Just customizing what it looks like would make it a lot of fun.

<h4>Reflection</h4>

From the interview I was able to gather a few key insights that help in the task of creating more methods for easier and deeper family connection. One of the main key insights from the interview was that in families it often the case for parents to not feel as open to services such as counseling or therapy. This is an existing idea among many families that prevents family members looking for deeper connection from using these services. Another key insight found was that offering lists of how to make families connect is impersonal and thus hard to act on. The interviewee looked for advice to connect with family through a website of anonymous users relying their personal stories. I think the interview best shows how family counseling and therapy is not an option for many families due to the stigma surrounding it, which highlights a need for a less invasive form of servicing that allows for family connection.

I learned quite a bit from the interview. First, I believe I should have prepared more questions surrounding family stigma's and values around certain items like therapy or counseling. I believe it would have been more beneficial if I made it a point to emphasize how certain feelings surrounding subjects like mental health play a large role in how connected a family feels. I also learned that it would be helpful to the interviewee if the activities were less vague and had clearer instruction.
