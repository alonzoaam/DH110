# Assignment 2: Usability Testing

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Usability testing is a form of human behavioral research in which an observer collects empirical data from representative end users using the product.
During testing, end users perform realistic tasks set by the observer and are asked to follow a consent form and questionnaire relating to the tasks performed.

There are three main goals of usability testing;
  * Informing design: how useful and satisfactory design is
  * Eliminating frustration: early inspection before release
  * Improving profitability: reduce the cost of service and support; increase satisfaction

In this assignment we will perform usability testing on the Cozi, a mobile app that allows families to create shared calendar events, plans, and lists.
Usability testing will be used to uncover and rediscover design problems in Cozi's UI based on Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.

In this GitHub repository under Assignments/Assignment-01/README.md, we can recall that performing heuristic evaluation on Cozi uncovered three main design flaws:
  * Recognition rather than recall: Information is not easily realized by the user.
  * Flexibility and efficiency of use: Users of varying levels do not have different methods to perform the same task.
  * Aesthetic and minimalist design: The app contains information that is abundant and not necessary to the use.
