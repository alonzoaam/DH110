# Assignment 2: Usability Testing

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Usability testing is a form of human behavioral research in which an observer collects empirical data from representative end users using the product.
During testing, end users perform realistic tasks set by the observer and are asked to follow a consent form and questionnaire relating to the tasks performed.

There are three main goals of usability testing;
  * Informing design: how useful and satisfactory design is
  * Eliminating frustration: early inspection before release
  * Improving profitability: reduce the cost of service and support; increase satisfaction

In this assignment we will perform usability testing on the Cozi, a mobile app that allows families to create shared calendar events, plans, and lists.
Usability testing will be used to uncover and rediscover design problems in Cozi's UI based on Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.

In this GitHub repository under Assignments/Assignment-01/README.md, we can recall that performing heuristic evaluation on Cozi uncovered three main design flaws:
  * Recognition rather than recall: Information is not easily realized by the user.
  * Flexibility and efficiency of use: Users of varying levels do not have different methods to perform the same task.
  * Aesthetic and minimalist design: The app contains information that is abundant and not necessary to the use.

The pilot usability testing took place in my apartment in Los Angeles, California. The participant was asked to perform various functions on the Cozi app and asked to fill out a questionnaire while doing so.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
This pilot test was my first introduction to usability testing. I learned that before testing, it would have been beneficial to first go through the test as if I was an end user. Second, it may have been helpful to provide myself with a script in the event of any setbacks in the process. Third, I believed that I should have given the end user more information and to make it a point that I would not be offended by any answer. I thought the test went fairly well, but I could not help but feel like I did not give the end user the proper context needed to take the test. One flaw in my test was the lack of a frame of reference for the end user. Initially showing and asking for feedback on just one app restricted the amount of information that we both had. However, the findings in the test did speak on the previously mentioned cluttered design and abundant ads in Cozi.


I hope to improve my usability test in the future by providing another app for end users to perform the same tasks in. While the tasks given were trivial, I believe more can be said about the design flaws when an end user has two platforms to compare.
