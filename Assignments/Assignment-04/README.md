<h1>The Purpose of UX Storytelling</h1>
My project aims to find way for family members to better connect in a digital space. Through UX Storytelling, designers create personas of product end users in order to change their perspectives to what an actual user of a product may have envisioned. By creating personas, designers can have a shared and concrete view of the first users on their platform.
