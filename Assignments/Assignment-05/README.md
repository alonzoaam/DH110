<h1>Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h1>
My project is a family-connection app that serves to offer users the ability to create groups with their family.
In the app, users are able to invite family members, edit a shared calendar, edit shared lists, as well as answer daily wellness questions and view other family member's answers and status.
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to give myself the ability to view the first possible UX design of the proposed app.
By creating a low-fidelity prototype, designers are able to view and hash out the pages and functionality in an app without actually developing it.
This method saves designers time, and gives them the ability to have other users test specific tasks and provide early feedback.

<h2>Supported Tasks</h2>
The current prototype can support two tasks:
The first task shows the functionality of the wellness tab.

1. Go to Wellness Tab
2. Select "Answer Daily Question"
3. Answer Daily Question
4. Check Family Member Emotion
5. Go to Home Tab
<br></br>

The second task shows the functionality of the events tab.
1. Check Planning Tab
2. Check Calendar
3. Sort to week view
4. See events posted
5. Go Back
6. Check Lists
7. See Grocery List
8. Click off an Item
