Hi, this is my course website for DH110. 
The project I plan on working on is a family connection app that takes the features of current family connection apps (such as to-do lists, calendars, shared recipes, etc.) and implement features that allow for closer family connection. Specifically, this app will encourage family members to answer a daily question regarding emotions or thoughts about a specific topic in order to encourage a more open connection between family members.
