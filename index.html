  <h1>Fonnect, a Family App</h1>
  
  <h2>Alonzo Murrieta</h2>
    
    <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Hi, this is a website meant to showcase the progress and results of the project I undertook in DH110. The project I designed is a family connection app that takes the features of current family connection apps such as shared lists and a shared calendar, and implement features that allow for closer family connection. Specifically, this app will encourage family members to answer a daily question regarding emotions or thoughts about a specific topic in order to encourage a more open connection between family members.</p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of the project's course, we were tasked to create a design centered around the idea of "connection". From this prompt, I chose to design an app that allows for family members to connect with eachother in increasingly busier times. One key point I wanted my design to focus on was to alleviate some of the pains surrounding mental health and wellness topics and conversations in a family space, where many members of traditional families feel as if many of these topics are hush-hush. With this idea, I felt it would be reasonable to combine a mental wellness feature with traditional organizational features such as a shared calendar.</p>
    
  <h3>Clear Design Statement</h3>
  <p>The current existing issue is that many families around the world do not partake in learning and understanding each others mental health and overall wellness due to a variety of factors. Fonnect aims to connect families through shared organizational features and a mental wellness feature so that families can stay connected digitally.</p>
